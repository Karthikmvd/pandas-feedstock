Summary: Powerful data structures for data analysis, time series,and statistics

**pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data
structures designed to make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional,
potentially heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive. It
aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical,
**real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal
of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis /
manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on its way
toward this goal.mew

pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:

  - Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or
    Excel spreadsheet
  - Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.
  - Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and
    column labels
  - Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually
    need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure

The two primary data structures of pandas, Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame
(2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use cases in finance,
statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering. For R users,
DataFrame provides everything that R's ``data.frame`` provides and much
more. pandas is built on top of `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`__ and is
intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with many
other 3rd party libraries.

Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:

  - Easy handling of **missing data** (represented as NaN) in floating point as
    well as non-floating point data
  - Size mutability: columns can be **inserted and deleted** from DataFrame and
    higher dimensional objects
  - Automatic and explicit **data alignment**: objects can be explicitly
    aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and
    let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in
    computations
  - Powerful, flexible **group by** functionality to perform
    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and
    transforming data
  - Make it **easy to convert** ragged, differently-indexed data in other
    Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects
  - Intelligent label-based **slicing**, **fancy indexing**, and **subsetting**
    of large data sets
  - Intuitive **merging** and **joining** data sets
  - Flexible **reshaping** and pivoting of data sets
  - **Hierarchical** labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per
    tick)
  - Robust IO tools for loading data from **flat files** (CSV and delimited),
    Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast **HDF5
    format**
  - **Time series**-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency
    conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions,
    date shifting and lagging, etc.

Many of these principles are here to address the shortcomings frequently
experienced using other languages / scientific research environments. For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas is
the ideal tool for all of these tasks.

Installing pandas
=================

Installing `pandas` from the `conda-forge` channel can be achieved by adding `conda-forge` to your channels with:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `pandas` can be installed with:

```
conda install pandas
```

It is possible to list all of the versions of `pandas` available on your platform with:

```
conda search pandas --channel conda-forge
```


About conda-forge
=================

conda-forge is a community-led conda channel of installable packages.
In order to provide high-quality builds, the process has been automated into the
conda-forge GitHub organization. The conda-forge organization contains one repository
for each of the installable packages. Such a repository is known as a *feedstock*.

A feedstock is made up of a conda recipe (the instructions on what and how to build
the package) and the necessary configurations for automatic building using freely
available continuous integration services. Thanks to the awesome service provided by
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [AppVeyor](http://www.appveyor.com/)
and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) it is possible to build and upload installable
packages to the [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge)
[Anaconda-Cloud](http://docs.anaconda.org/) channel for Linux, Windows and OSX respectively.

To manage the continuous integration and simplify feedstock maintenance
[conda-smithy](http://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy) has been developed.
Using the ``conda-forge.yml`` within this repository, it is possible to re-render all of
this feedstock's supporting files (e.g. the CI configuration files) with ``conda smithy rerender``.

For more information please check the [conda-forge documentation](https://conda-forge.org/docs/).

Terminology
===========

**feedstock** - the conda recipe (raw material), supporting scripts and CI configuration.

**conda-smithy** - the tool which helps orchestrate the feedstock.
                   Its primary use is in the construction of the CI ``.yml`` files
                   and simplify the management of *many* feedstocks.

**conda-forge** - the place where the feedstock and smithy live and work to
                  produce the finished article (built conda distributions)


Updating pandas-feedstock
=========================

If you would like to improve the pandas recipe or build a new
package version, please fork this repository and submit a PR. Upon submission,
your changes will be run on the appropriate platforms to give the reviewer an
opportunity to confirm that the changes result in a successful build. Once
merged, the recipe will be re-built and uploaded automatically to the
`conda-forge` channel, whereupon the built conda packages will be available for
everybody to install and use from the `conda-forge` channel.
Note that all branches in the conda-forge/pandas-feedstock are
immediately built and any created packages are uploaded, so PRs should be based
on branches in forks and branches in the main repository should only be used to
build distinct package versions.

In order to produce a uniquely identifiable distribution:
 * If the version of a package **is not** being increased, please add or increase
   the [``build/number``](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/building/meta-yaml.html#build-number-and-string).
 * If the version of a package **is** being increased, please remember to return
   the [``build/number``](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/building/meta-yaml.html#build-number-and-string)
   back to 0.
